## D-000 — Historic First Compile

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 0 (pre-implementation baseline)
**Spec reference:** —

The first successful compile of the XGen Protocol codebase. No protocol logic implemented — both `xgen-node` and `xgen-client` were pure stubs printing a placeholder line. Marked retroactively as version `0.0.0` in semantic terms: state=0 (building), section=0 (no section started), session=0.

The compile itself took seconds. However, the first two attempts froze overnight and for several hours respectively due to Google Drive file locking on build artifacts. Resolved by moving `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to a local path (`C:/cargo-targets/XGenProtocol`) outside the synced folder.

Tagged on GitHub as `v0.1.0` (build infrastructure baseline). Real versioning — `[state].[section].[session].[build]` — begins with D-001 and the first line of Wire Format code.

---

## D-001 — Versioning Scheme

**Date:** 2026-04-27 (revised 2026-04-28)
**Layer:** 0 (pre-implementation baseline)
**Spec reference:** —

Adopted a three-component version format: `[state].[layer].[session]`

- **state** — 0 while building Phase 1; 1 when Phase 1 complete and stable
- **layer** — implementation layer number (1–10, per IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_ph1.md)
- **session** — work session in which that layer was completed

`Cargo.toml` stores this three-part version. Layer numbering follows the implementation order, not the spec section order (spec sections are non-sequential by necessity — e.g., Layer 6 implements spec 3.4). Using layer numbers makes tags monotonically increasing: v0.1.1 → v0.2.2 → … → v0.9.3.

Originally the second component was intended to be the spec section number, which produced non-monotonic tags (e.g., v0.4.2 for Layer 6 before v0.5.2 for Layer 5). Corrected to layer numbers in session 3.

---

## D-002 — Layer 1: Keypair Encryption Scheme

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 1 — Cryptographic Foundation
**Spec reference:** 3.5.1

The spec requires keypairs to be "encrypted at rest" but does not prescribe the encryption algorithm. Chose **ChaCha20-Poly1305** (AEAD) with **Argon2id** key derivation.

- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** — modern, well-audited AEAD cipher. No timing side-channels from table lookups (unlike AES without hardware acceleration). Available in the `chacha20poly1305` crate.
- **Argon2id** — current recommended KDF for password-based key derivation (RFC 9106). Resistant to GPU and side-channel attacks. Parameters for Phase 1: m=64MB, t=3, p=1 — tuned for interactive use.
- **Phase 1 passphrase** — Local Node mode uses an empty string passphrase. The file is still encrypted (the AEAD tag still provides integrity), but without meaningful key stretching. A non-empty passphrase is supported and works correctly. Production deployments must use a strong passphrase.

File format: JSON with `version`, `algorithm`, `kdf`, `salt` (base64url, 32 bytes), `nonce` (base64url, 12 bytes), `ciphertext` (base64url, 48 bytes = 32-byte key + 16-byte AEAD tag).

---

## D-003 — Layer 1: SigningKey Generation Without rand_core Feature

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 1 — Cryptographic Foundation
**Spec reference:** 3.5.1

`ed25519-dalek v2` exposes `SigningKey::generate(&mut rng)` only when the `rand_core` feature flag is enabled. To avoid adding a feature flag, keypair generation uses `OsRng.fill_bytes()` to produce 32 random bytes and constructs the key with `SigningKey::from_bytes()`. This is equivalent — `SigningKey::generate` does the same internally.

---

## D-004 — Layer 2: Event Fields `event_id` and `signature` as `Option<String>`

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 2 — Wire Format
**Spec reference:** 3.2.1, 3.2.3, 3.2.4

The spec defines `event_id` and `signature` as required fields on received Events, but they cannot exist during construction — `event_id` is derived by hashing the canonical form, and `signature` is produced by signing those same bytes. Both fields are therefore `Option<String>` with `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.

This means an unsigned, unsigned Event serialises without those fields (correct for computing the canonical form), and a signed Event includes them (correct for the wire). The validation pipeline (step 3) enforces presence on received Events; the type system prevents accidental use of an unsigned Event where a signed one is required.

---

## D-005 — Layer 3: Root Event Types Require Empty `prev_events`

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 3 — DAG Event Store
**Spec reference:** 3.2.5

The spec defines `prev_events` DAG rules but does not explicitly enumerate which event types are DAG roots. Decided that `state.space_create`, `state.dm_space_create`, and `state.room_create` are root types (empty `prev_events` required). All other event types must reference at least one predecessor.

Rationale: Space and Room creation events are the structural origins of their respective DAGs — they have no meaningful predecessors within the same namespace. Enforcing empty `prev_events` on these types makes the DAG structure explicit and prevents accidental chaining that would complicate state derivation.

---

## D-006 — Layer 3: Cycle Detection Reduces to Self-Reference Check

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 3 — DAG Event Store
**Spec reference:** 3.2.5

Full cycle detection (verifying no `prev_event` is a descendant of the new Event) is expensive — it requires a graph traversal. For a newly inserted Event this reduces to a single check: does the Event reference itself? A new Event has no descendants yet, so no other cycle is possible at insertion time. Only self-reference (`event_id ∈ prev_events`) needs an explicit check.

This is correct as an invariant because the store is append-only: once an event_id is in the store, no future Event can retroactively become its ancestor.

---

## D-007 — Layer 3: Phase 1 `prev_events` Fanin Limit = 10

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 3 — DAG Event Store
**Spec reference:** 3.2.5

The spec does not specify a hard limit on `prev_events` entries for Phase 1. Chose 10 as a practical ceiling that accommodates realistic concurrent edit scenarios while preventing degenerate inputs. Phase 2 may revisit based on observed network behaviour.

---

## D-008 — Layer 5: Node Announcement TTL = 90 Days

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 5 — Node Identity and Announcement
**Spec reference:** 3.5.6

The spec requires announcements to carry a `valid_until` field but does not prescribe the TTL duration. Chose 90 days for Phase 1. This is long enough that operators on routine schedules (e.g., weekly restarts) never need to worry about expiry, but short enough that a decommissioned node's announcement falls off peer tables within a quarter. Expiry is checked before signature verification to avoid wasting crypto work on stale announcements.

---

## D-009 — Layer 6: Federation `session_id` Derivation

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 6 — Federation Handshake
**Spec reference:** 3.4.4

The spec requires a `session_id` to be agreed during the handshake but does not specify its derivation. Chose: `hash_uri(sort([node_a_id, node_b_id]) + timestamp)` where node IDs are sorted alphabetically before concatenation.

Sorting ensures the same `session_id` is independently computed by both sides regardless of which is initiating and which is receiving. The timestamp is taken from the `federation.hello` message so both sides use the same value.

---

## D-010 — Layer 6: `FederationMessage` Signing Excludes `signature` via Field Order Constants

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 6 — Federation Handshake
**Spec reference:** 3.4.3

Each `FederationMessage` variant carries `signature: Option<String>` with `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`. The canonical form for signing uses per-variant field order constants that do not include `"signature"`, so the signature field is always absent from the bytes that get signed — whether it is `None` (unsigned) or `Some` (already signed). This avoids the need to temporarily clear the field before computing the canonical form.

---

## D-011 — Layer 7: `MAX_DISPLAY_NAME_LEN` = 128

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 7 — Identity Registration
**Spec reference:** 3.6.5

The spec requires display name validation but does not prescribe a maximum length. Chose 128 characters (Unicode code points). This comfortably accommodates real names, handles emoji and CJK characters, and is simple to communicate. Empty strings and strings containing control characters (codepoints < 0x20) are also rejected.

---

## D-012 — Layer 7: Phase 1 Uses `identity_id` as `device_id`

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 7 — Identity Registration
**Spec reference:** 3.6.6

The spec defines a `devices` array for multi-device support. Phase 1 supports one device per Identity. Rather than omitting the `devices` array entirely, the registration pipeline populates it with a single entry using `identity_id` as the `device_id`. This keeps the wire schema stable for Phase 2 multi-device support without breaking changes.

---

## D-013 — Layer 8: Empty `room_id` Distinguishes Space-Level Events from Room-Level Events

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 8 — Space and Room Protocol
**Spec reference:** 3.7.1, 3.7.3

The spec defines both Space-level and Room-level events sharing the same `Event` envelope. Rather than introducing a separate envelope field, the existing `room_id` field doubles as a discriminator: an empty string means the event targets the Space; a non-empty string means it targets a specific Room. This is consistent with the spec's use of `room_id = ""` on `state.space_create`.

The `apply_event` state machine and the Layer 9 pipeline both branch on `room_id.is_empty()` before dispatching.

---

## D-014 — Layer 8: `apply_join` Branches on `room_id` Before Membership Check

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 8 — Space and Room Protocol
**Spec reference:** 3.7.5

The initial implementation of `apply_join` checked `self.members.contains_key(joiner)` before branching on whether the event was a Space join or a Room join. This caused existing Space members to receive `AlreadyMember` when trying to join a Room (because they were already in `self.members`). Fixed by checking `room_id.is_empty()` first — if non-empty, route to the Room join path; if empty, route to the Space join path with its own duplicate check.

---

## D-015 — Layer 8: `state.space_create` and `state.room_create` Have Empty ID Fields During Construction

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Layer:** 8 — Space and Room Protocol
**Spec reference:** 3.2.3, 3.7.2

Both `space_id` and `room_id` are derived as `event_id`, which is computed by hashing the canonical event bytes. This creates a circular dependency: the ID fields cannot be known before serialisation, but they must be part of the canonical form. Resolution: event builders set both fields to empty strings during construction. `sign_event` then computes `event_id = hash_uri(canonical_bytes)` — the empty strings are part of the canonical form and the resulting hash becomes the ID. Callers set `space_id` / `room_id` in subsequent events using the derived value.

---

## D-016 — Layer 9: `validate_steps_8_13` Is Read-Only; Callers Control Insertion

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 9 — Message Exchange
**Spec reference:** 3.2.6

Steps 8–13 of the validation pipeline are implemented as a pure read-only function (`validate_steps_8_13`). It does not mutate the `EventStore` or `DagGraph`. Mutation happens only in `accept_event`, which calls the validator and then inserts on success.

This design lets callers inspect the specific failure reason before deciding whether to buffer (step 9 `HeldPending`) or reject (all other errors). It also makes the validator easily testable in isolation without needing mutable state.

Step 10 (DAG structural check) intentionally duplicates the logic from `DagGraph::add_event` rather than extracting a shared helper, because the DAG check requires a read-only view — there is no `DagGraph::validate_only` method and adding one would be scope creep.

---

## D-017 — Layer 9: Test Setup Merges Two DAG Roots via Invite `prev_events`

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 9 — Message Exchange
**Spec reference:** 3.2.5

In test setup, `state.space_create` and `state.room_create` are both DAG root events (empty `prev_events`). Without intervention, they remain as two independent tips indefinitely. The first membership event (`membership.invite`) references both roots as `prev=[space_id, room_id]`, merging the two roots into a single linear chain and leaving exactly one tip. This ensures message events have a single, unambiguous predecessor for `prev_events` in tests.

This is a test-only convention. In production, the protocol does not require roots to be merged — two persistent tips are valid DAG state.

---

## D-018 — meta_atts Key Namespace: Dot Separator, Reverse-Domain Ownership

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (protocol specification)
**Spec reference:** 3.1.3

`meta_atts` keys follow a dot-separated namespace scheme: `<namespace>.<key>`. The `xgen.` prefix is reserved for specification use. Third-party keys MUST use reverse-domain prefixes (e.g. `com.example.my_key`). Key segments use `snake_case`. Max key length 128 characters. Values are strings; structured values must be JSON-encoded as strings rather than embedded as nested objects.

Spec 3.1.3 updated accordingly.

---

## D-019 — Transport Pluggability: WebSocket as Default, Alternative Streams Permitted

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (protocol specification)
**Spec reference:** 3.3.1

WebSocket over TLS is the mandatory production transport. However, the spec explicitly permits operators to substitute any reliable bidirectional stream transport (Tor hidden services, I2P, pluggable transport proxies) without protocol-layer changes. This is noted in spec 3.3.1. DPI-resistance via custom transports is flagged as a Phase 3 investigation area — no Phase 1 or Phase 2 work required.

---

## D-020 — File Placement: Two-Tier Model (System Files vs User-Configurable Files)

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (deployment model)
**Spec reference:** IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_ph1.md — Deployment Model

Refined the Pattern A deployment model into an explicit two-tier system. Tier 1 (system files: config, registries, announcements) is mandatory co-location with the binary — not configurable. Tier 2 (keypair, TLS cert, logs, UI settings) defaults to binary folder but can be redirected via explicit config fields. This accommodates HSM-backed keys, OS keystore integration (Phase 2), and system log aggregation without scattering files by default. No file moves silently — every Tier 2 redirect requires an explicit config entry.

---

## D-021 — Self Account (`self`): Local-Only Synthetic Identity, Post-Phase-1

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (deferred post-Phase-1 feature)
**Spec reference:** —

A `self` account (analogous to Skype's own-account or Telegram's Saved Messages) is planned for implementation after the Phase 1 smoke test, during local testing. Design decision: `self` is a local-only synthetic Identity with its own keypair, never registered on any Node and never appearing in federation. It signs local Events but those Events are never broadcast. The `self` account must be accessible from any user client connecting to the Node — it is not device-local. In Phase 2, a "Saved Messages" Space may be implemented as a proper DM Space where both sides of the DM are the user's own keypair.

---

## D-022 — xgen-core Library Split: Deferred to Post-Phase-1

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (architecture — deferred)
**Spec reference:** —

All protocol logic currently lives in `xgen-node/src/`. A planned post-Phase-1 restructure will extract this into a new `xgen-core` crate: GPL-licensed from day one, the primary library for third-party developers. `xgen-node` and `xgen-client` become thin runtime shells wrapping `xgen-core`, retaining their BSL 1.1 wrapper. `xgen-common` remains as shared serde types.

Rationale for deferring: restructuring crates mid-implementation introduces risk right before the Phase 1 finish line. Do the smoke test first, tag Phase 1 complete, then restructure as the first Phase 2 prep task.

---

## D-023 — Traffic Masking / DPI Resistance: Phase 3 Investigation

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 0 (deferred — Phase 3)
**Spec reference:** 3.3.1

Deep-packet-inspection resistance (obfuscating XGen traffic to evade state-level network surveillance) is acknowledged as a legitimate concern. Phase 1 and Phase 2 impact: none — transport pluggability (D-019) already ensures Tor/I2P are usable without protocol changes, which is sufficient for most adversarial environments. Active DPI resistance (disguising XGen traffic as generic HTTPS, pluggable transport integration) is flagged as a Phase 3 area of investigation. Steganographic transport is explicitly out of scope for the core protocol.

---

## D-024 — History Sync: Individual Events, Not Batch Snapshot

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Layer:** 10 — Smoke Test
**Spec reference:** 3.7.10 (step 8), 3.7.11

The spec requires Node A to "send full Space state and Room Event history to Node B" (step 11 of the smoke test) but does not prescribe a wire format. Two options were considered: (a) individual Events sent one by one, (b) a new batch snapshot message type.

Chose **individual Events**. Rationale: Events are already the atomic protocol unit; every federated Node must be able to validate each Event independently; no new message type is needed; and the individual approach scales correctly to Phase 2 where `transport.sync_request` handles catching up on missed Events after reconnection — it is additive, not a replacement. Batch delivery would require defining a new message type that Phase 2 would likely supersede anyway.

In the smoke test, Node A sends history Events in insertion order over the active connection, followed by the `state.federation_add` Event (which references the pre-history tip as its `prev_events`, and therefore must be received after the history to be correctly linked in Node B's DAG). Connection is closed with `transport.goodbye` to signal end of sync.

---

## D-025 — File Naming Convention: `xgen-node_*` and `xgen-client_*` Prefixes

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Layer:** 0 (deployment model)
**Spec reference:** IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_ph1.md — Deployment Model, Ch4 section 4.3

All runtime files produced or consumed by a binary are prefixed with the binary name: `xgen-node_*` for Node files, `xgen-client_*` for client files.

Rationale: when two Node instances run side by side for testing (NodeA and NodeB folders), every file in the folder is immediately identifiable by name alone — no ambiguity about which binary owns it. Also makes glob patterns unambiguous in scripts (`xgen-node_*.db`, `xgen-client_*.toml`).

Applied to: config (`xgen-node_config.toml`), keypair (`xgen-node_keypair.enc`), state file (`xgen-node_state.json`), databases (`xgen-node_identities.db`, `xgen-node_federation.db`), logs (`xgen-node.log`). Space databases are in a `spaces/` subfolder and are named by space ID hex — the subfolder itself provides the ownership context.

---

## D-026 — Status File (`*_state.json`): Plain JSON, File Permissions as Security Boundary

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Layer:** 0 (deployment model / CLI design)
**Spec reference:** Ch4 section 4.14

**What the state file contains**

The running Node writes `xgen-node_state.json` to its application folder every 5 seconds. It contains operational metadata: node ID (a public key — already public by protocol design), uptime, connected client identity IDs and display names, federated peer endpoints, hosted space names, and event counts. The client writes `xgen-client_state.json` with: identity ID, display name, known nodes, joined spaces, and last activity timestamps.

**Why it is safe for Phase 1**

No secret material ever enters the state file. The private key lives only in `*_keypair.enc` (encrypted at rest). Signatures are computed in memory and never written to disk in plaintext. The state file contains only information that is already visible to any authenticated participant in the protocol — a connected client can already see who else is in a Space.

**What it leaks and to whom**

The state file leaks topology: who is connected to this Node, which peers it federates with, which Spaces it hosts. This is only a concern if a third party has filesystem read access to the Node's application folder. On a personal development machine: not a concern. On a shared server: the file MUST be protected by OS-level file permissions (Unix: `chmod 600`; Windows: restrict ACL to the operator account). The Node SHOULD set these permissions itself on first write.

**Planned improvements for Phase 2**

Three improvements are planned but explicitly deferred beyond Phase 1:

1. **Redact identity IDs from state file** — replace full `pubkey_uri` values with display names only, or truncated IDs. The full public key of a connected user is already public, but there is no reason to persist it in a file that may be read by monitoring tools.

2. **Separate admin socket** — replace the file-based status mechanism with a Unix domain socket (or named pipe on Windows) that only the operator's process can connect to. Status commands connect to the socket rather than reading a file. This eliminates the file entirely and makes the data available only to processes with the right OS credentials.

3. **Encrypted state file** — encrypt the state file with a key derived from the node keypair passphrase. Only the operator who can unlock the keypair can read the state file. Adds meaningful protection on shared infrastructure without requiring the admin socket approach.

For Phase 1, file permissions are the sufficient and correct mitigation. The planned improvements are recorded here so they are not forgotten when Phase 2 deployment hardening is scoped.

## D-027 — CLI Observability Commands: Phase 1 Scope Extension

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Layer:** 0 (CLI design — Phase 1 scope extension)
**Spec reference:** Ch4 section 4.16

The original Phase 1 definition of done (spec 3.7.11, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_ph1.md Layer 10) specifies the smoke test as the completion criterion. It does not specify a CLI interface beyond what is needed to drive the smoke test.

The following commands are added to Phase 1 scope as a deliberate extension:

**xgen-node:** `status`, `connections`, `spaces`, `peers`, `identity list`
**xgen-client:** `status`, `spaces`, `whoami`

**Rationale:** the smoke test proves the library works in-process. Runnable binaries need to be observable — an operator running two Nodes on localhost needs to see that they are alive, that clients are connected, and that federation is active. Without these commands, the only evidence the system works is log output. These commands transform log output into structured, queryable state.

All observability commands read `xgen-node_state.json` or `xgen-client_state.json` (D-026) — they do not open a new network connection to the running process. This keeps them instant and dependency-free.

**These commands are NOT Phase 2 work.** They are Phase 1 CLI completeness. Phase 2 will replace or supplement them with a GUI dashboard. The state file mechanism (D-026) persists into Phase 2 as the data source for that dashboard.

**What is explicitly NOT in Phase 1 CLI scope:**
- Admin operations that modify Node state (ban identity, force-disconnect peer, etc.) — Phase 2
- Real-time streaming output (live event feed, live connection monitor) — Phase 2
- Auth Module management commands — Phase 2
- Multi-node management (controlling a remote Node) — Phase 2

---

## D-028 — `--help` Built-in: clap Derive Macros, Section 4.16 as Authoritative Source

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Layer:** 0 (CLI design)
**Spec reference:** Ch4 section 4.16

`clap` with derive macros generates `--help` output automatically from doc comments (`///`) on struct fields and command variants. The help text in the source code is therefore documentation — it must match section 4.16 of Ch4 exactly.

The authoring rule: write section 4.16 first. Copy the argument descriptions and examples from 4.16 into the Rust doc comments. Never write help text in the code first and retrofit it into 4.16 — the spec is the source of truth, the code is the implementation.

Both `xgen-node --help` and `xgen-client --help` (and all subcommand `--help` variants) are generated by clap at compile time from these doc comments. No hand-written help strings.

---

## D-029 — xgen-client depends on xgen-node lib for Phase 1 binary wiring

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Layer:** 0 (binary wiring)
**Spec reference:** D-022 (xgen-core crate split, Phase 2)

`xgen-client` depends directly on the `xgen-node` library crate for Phase 1 binary wiring. This gives the client access to the transport layer (`Connection`, `connect_url`), wire types (`Event`, `IdentityMessage`, etc.), federation handshake, identity registration protocol, event building, and crypto — without duplicating ~2 000 lines of code.

The "circular" concern mentioned earlier was conceptual (two binaries sharing a library), not a Cargo constraint. `xgen-client → xgen-node-lib` is a valid, acyclic dependency.

In Phase 2, D-022 (xgen-core crate) extracts the shared protocol logic from `xgen-node` into a new `xgen-core` library. Both `xgen-node` and `xgen-client` will depend on `xgen-core` instead. The direct `xgen-client → xgen-node` dependency is replaced at that point.
