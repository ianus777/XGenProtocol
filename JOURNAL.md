## Entry J-001 — Project Inception

**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Commit:** `43c6e28e` / `3b9a5660` — *Initial commit: XGen Protocol philosophy v0.3*

The XGen Protocol project was initiated. The initial commit establishes the philosophical
foundation of the protocol: a federated, open-source communication infrastructure layer
designed to sit beneath chat, community, and voice applications. The core thesis — that
no single entity should own the communication layer — is documented in `docs/xgen_ch1_philosophy.md`.

The protocol is conceived as a public infrastructure primitive, not a product.

## Entry J-002 — Repository Organisation

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Commits:** `31b898d7` through `a75579d1`

Repository structure established. Legacy brainstorm documents removed. `.gitignore` created.
Document hierarchy reorganised into `docs/` directory. Project identity consolidated under
the XGen Protocol name.

---

## Entry J-003 — Philosophy and Architecture Documentation

**Date:** 2026-04-24 to 2026-04-25
**Commits:** `69231d0a` through `20968fe7`

Chapters 1 and 2 of the protocol documentation written:

- `docs/xgen_ch1_philosophy.md` — project philosophy and motivation
- `docs/xgen_ch2_architecture.md` — architecture design and primitives

The primitive hierarchy (Space → Room → Thread → Event) is defined. The cross-cutting
primitives — Identity (server-independent Ed25519 keypair) and Auth Module (pluggable
trust assertion) — are established as foundational design decisions.

---

## Entry J-004 — Technical Specification Complete (Phase 1 Scope)

**Date:** 2026-04-25 to 2026-04-26
**Commits:** `49fd0707` through `dc635409`

The authoritative technical specification is written and completed for Phase 1 scope:
`docs/xgen_ch3_specification.md`, sections 3.1 through 3.8.

Sections completed:

| Section | Title |
|---------|-------|
| 3.1 | Wire Format |
| 3.2 | Event Specification |
| 3.3 | Transport Protocol |
| 3.4 | Federation Handshake |
| 3.5 | Node Identity Protocol |
| 3.6 | Identity Registration Protocol |
| 3.7 | Space & Room Protocol |
| 3.8 | Auth Module — Tier 1 |

Sections 3.9–3.16 (Phase 2) are specified as deferred.

`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_ph1.md` written — a 10-layer implementation roadmap for Phase 1,
specifying exact file structure, crate dependencies, testing strategy, and the Phase 1
definition of done (17-step smoke test, spec 3.7.11).

Rust crate skeleton committed: `xgen-common`, `xgen-node`, `xgen-client` with stub
`main.rs` and `lib.rs` files. All source files carry the BSL 1.1 copyright header.

License file added: BSL 1.1.

## Entry J-005 — Build Infrastructure and Versioning System

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** `14b0c6ab` — *Add build infrastructure and versioning system*
**Tag:** `v0.1.0`

First successful compilation of the XGen Protocol codebase. The build infrastructure
is established:

- **Build target directory** moved to `C:/cargo-targets/XGenProtocol` (outside Google
  Drive) to prevent file locking by the Google Drive sync process, which caused the
  first two build attempts to freeze indefinitely.
- **`build.sh`** wrapper script: runs `cargo build` and copies output binaries to
  `bin/` in the project folder on Google Drive.
- **Versioning system** adopted — four-component format `[state].[section].[session].[build]`:
  - `state` — 0 while building; 1 when Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete and stable
  - `section` — spec section being implemented (1–16, mapping to spec 3.1–3.16)
  - `session` — increments each work session
  - `build` — auto-captured at compile time as `yymmdd-hhmm`
- **Build banner** — both binaries print version, git hash, and UTC build timestamp
  on startup, implemented in `xgen-common::build_info`.
- **`DECISIONS.md`** created — running log of implementation decisions beyond spec
  prescription, to be used as source material for Chapter 4 documentation.

Binaries at this point are stubs only. Retroactively designated version `0.0.0` in
semantic terms (no protocol logic implemented).

## Entry J-006 — Layer 1: Cryptographic Foundation

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** `1a2143b3` — *Implement Layer 1 — cryptographic foundation (25 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.1.1`

Layer 1 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. All five cryptographic primitive
modules are implemented in `xgen-node/src/`, with 25 unit tests — all passing.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `crypto/encoding.rs` | 3.1.9 | base64url encode/decode, RFC 4648 §5, no padding, rejects standard base64 characters |
| `crypto/hashing.rs` | 3.2.3 | SHA-256 hash, lowercase hex output, hash URI format `xgen://hash/sha256:<hex>` |
| `crypto/signing.rs` | 3.2.4 | Ed25519 sign and verify, signature string format `ed25519:<base64url-pubkey>:<base64url-sig>` |
| `identity/keypair.rs` | 3.5.1 | Ed25519 keypair generation, encrypted file storage (ChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id KDF), loading |
| `wire/canonical.rs` | 3.2.4 | Canonical Event JSON: fixed field order, sorted nested object keys, excludes `event_id` and `signature` |

Test coverage: 6 encoding tests, 4 hashing tests, 6 signing tests, 3 keypair tests,
6 canonical form tests.

New dependencies added: `chacha20poly1305 = 0.10`, `argon2 = 0.5`.

## Entry J-007 — License Header Correction and Development Journal

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commits:** `7118140` — *Add JOURNAL.md*, `a803166` — *Fix license headers*

Two corrections applied:

**License headers:** All 16 source files (`.rs`) carried an incorrect PolyForm Noncommercial
License 1.0.0 header — a mismatch with the project's actual BSL 1.1 license declared in
`LICENSE`. Headers replaced across all files with the correct BSL 1.1 header including
`SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1` and the change date clause. `CLAUDE.md` updated to
enforce the correct header for all future source files.

**Development journal:** This file (`JOURNAL.md`) created as a contemporaneous legal record
of development activity, separate from `DECISIONS.md` (which feeds Chapter 4 documentation).
Journal entries to be written at the close of each work session going forward.

## Entry J-008 — Layer 2: Wire Format

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 2 — wire format (53 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.1.2`

Layer 2 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Three modules implemented in
`xgen-node/src/wire/`, bringing the total test count from 25 (Layer 1) to 53.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `wire/types.rs` | 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.4 | `Event` envelope struct, `EventType` enum (15 variants), `TransportMessage` enum (8 variants), `MessageTextContent` |
| `wire/framing.rs` | 3.1.2 | Transport frame encode/decode — `[1B fmt_len][N fmt][4B pay_len BE][payload]`; Phase 1 format "json"; 256 KB ceiling |
| `wire/validation.rs` | 3.2.6 | Event validation pipeline steps 1–7 (structural checks; steps 8–13 deferred to Layer 3+) |

Test coverage added:

| Module | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| `wire/types.rs` | 8 — EventType round-trip, all-variants from_str, unknown returns None, Event serde, full envelope deserialise, transport message round-trips, MessageTextContent |
| `wire/framing.rs` | 7 — encode/decode round-trip, frame byte structure, empty payload, too-short buffer, incomplete payload, oversized payload rejection, Event JSON through frame |
| `wire/validation.rs` | 13 — one test per validation step (all 7 steps covered), valid event passes, field-type checks for array/object fields, timezone variants, validated fields accessible |

Design notes:
- `event_id` and `signature` are `Option<String>` in `Event` — absent during construction
  (before signing), required on received events (enforced by validation step 3).
- `EventType` carries both serde derive (dot-separated names) and `from_str`/`as_str`
  for use in validation without a full deserialise.
- `TransportMessage` uses `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]` — maps
  cleanly to the wire names `challenge`, `auth`, `auth_ok`, etc.
- All crate versions bumped to `0.1.2`.

---

## Entry J-009 — Layer 3: DAG Event Store

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 3 — DAG event store (79 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.1.3`

Layer 3 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Four modules implemented in
`xgen-node/src/dag/`, bringing the total test count from 53 (Layer 2) to 79.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `dag/store.rs` | 3.2.5 | `EventStore` — append-only in-memory store keyed by `event_id`; rejects duplicates and unsigned events |
| `dag/graph.rs` | 3.2.5 | `DagGraph` — tracks current DAG tips and successor relationships; validates all `prev_events` rules on insertion |
| `dag/pending.rs` | 3.2.5 | `PendingBuffer` — holds events whose predecessors are not yet known; releases them when all predecessors arrive (including cascading chains) |
| `dag/mod.rs` | 3.2.5 | `RoomDag` — unified API combining store, graph, and pending buffer into a single `insert()` call |

Test coverage added:

| Module | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| `dag/store.rs` | 5 — insert/retrieve, duplicate rejection, missing event_id, len/empty, unknown ID |
| `dag/graph.rs` | 10 — root tip, linear chain, fork (two tips), merge (collapse to one tip), self-reference, unknown prev, root with prev, non-root without prev, too many prev, missing event_id |
| `dag/pending.rs` | 5 — single predecessor release, two missing predecessors (partial then full), multiple events waiting for same predecessor, resolve unknown ID, contains |
| `dag/mod.rs` | 6 — linear chain, fork-and-merge, out-of-order delivery, cascading pending drain (chain of 3), retrieve by ID, duplicate rejection |

Key design decisions:
- Root event types (`state.room_create`, `state.space_create`, `state.dm_space_create`) require empty `prev_events`; all others require at least one.
- Cycle detection for new events reduces to self-reference check only — a new event has no descendants, so no other cycle is possible.
- `PendingBuffer.resolve()` cascades: resolving one event can unblock a chain, which `RoomDag.drain_pending()` handles recursively.
- Phase 1 `prev_events` limit: 10 entries (spec 3.2.5).
- No persistence in Phase 1 — the store is entirely in-process memory.

## Entry J-010 — Layer 4: WebSocket Transport

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 4 — WebSocket transport (88 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.1.4`

Layer 4 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Four modules implemented in
`xgen-node/src/transport/`, bringing the total test count from 79 (Layer 3) to 88.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `transport/auth.rs` | 3.3.4 | Challenge-response authentication — `issue_challenge()`, `build_auth_response()`, `verify_auth_response()`; error codes per spec 3.3.8 (1001–1004) |
| `transport/connection.rs` | 3.3.4, 3.3.9 | `Connection<S>` generic over stream type — `server_authenticate()`, `client_authenticate()`, `send_transport()`, `send_event()`, `recv()`, `goodbye()`, `ping()` |
| `transport/server.rs` | 3.3.1 | `Server` — `TcpListener` wrapper, `bind()` + `accept()`, upgrades TCP to WebSocket |
| `transport/client.rs` | 3.3.1 | `connect()` — outbound WebSocket connection to a peer Node |

Transport message type strings corrected in `wire/types.rs`: all variants now carry the `transport.` prefix (e.g., `transport.challenge`, `transport.auth_ok`) and the correct fields from spec 3.3.4, including `protocol_version` and `timestamp` on all messages.

Test coverage added:

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `auth::full_auth_round_trip` | Complete challenge → sign → verify cycle |
| `auth::wrong_nonce_rejected` | Nonce mismatch returns `NonceMismatch` |
| `auth::wrong_key_rejected` | Mismatched signature returns `SignatureInvalid` |
| `auth::wrong_message_type_rejected` | Non-Auth message returns `WrongMessageType` |
| `auth::identity_id_round_trip` | URI parse/format round-trip |
| `auth::error_codes_are_correct` | All four spec error codes (1001–1004) |
| `transport::connect_authenticate_ping_goodbye` | Full lifecycle: connect → auth → ping → goodbye |
| `transport::bad_signature_rejected` | Server sends auth_fail (code 1001) on forged signature |
| `transport::event_exchange_after_auth` | Event serialised, framed, sent, received, deserialised |

Design decisions:
- `Connection<S>` is generic over `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin` — server connections are `Connection<TcpStream>`, client connections are `Connection<MaybeTlsStream<TcpStream>>`.
- `Inbound` enum discriminates Event, TransportMessage, Ping, Pong, and Closed without requiring callers to inspect raw JSON.
- Signature covers raw nonce bytes (decoded from base64url), not the base64url string — per spec 3.3.4.
- Phase 1 Local Node mode: `ws://` only; no TLS paths.
- Keepalive (30s ping, 10s pong timeout) is implemented at the protocol level (`ping()` method); the scheduling loop is part of Layer 4 but will be wired into the Node runtime in Layer 5+.

## Entry J-011 — Layer 5: Node Identity and Announcement

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 5 — node identity and announcement (100 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.5.2`

Layer 5 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Two modules implemented in
`xgen-node/src/node/`, bringing the total test count from 88 (Layer 4) to 100.

Also corrected versioning in this session: tags `v0.1.2`/`v0.1.3`/`v0.1.4` were renamed
to `v0.2.2`/`v0.2.2-dag`/`v0.3.2` to match the `[state].[section].[session]` scheme.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `node/announcement.rs` | 3.5.2–3.5.6 | `NodeAnnouncement` — generate, sign, verify, save, load, supersedes check |
| `wire/canonical.rs` | 3.5.3 | Added `canonical_object_json(value, field_order)` — generic canonical serialiser for any signed object with a fixed field order; made `canonical_value` public |

Test coverage added (12 new tests):

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `generate_produces_valid_signature` | Freshly generated announcement passes verify() |
| `node_id_matches_signing_key` | node_id URI matches the signing key's public key |
| `tampered_endpoint_invalidates_signature` | Any field change breaks verification |
| `tampered_node_id_invalidates_signature` | Substituting a different key's node_id is caught |
| `higher_version_supersedes_lower` | v2.supersedes(v1) = true, v1.supersedes(v2) = false |
| `same_version_does_not_supersede` | Equal version → false |
| `different_node_does_not_supersede` | Different node_id → no supersession relationship |
| `expired_announcement_rejected` | valid_until in past → Expired error even if signature valid |
| `with_display_name` | Optional operator_display_name included in canonical form and signature |
| `save_load_round_trip` | JSON file persistence round-trip |
| `announcement_type_field_is_correct` | msg_type serialises as "type":"node_announcement" |
| `phase1_capabilities_are_json_only` | serialisation=["json"], compression=[], extensions=[] |

Design decisions:
- `NodeAnnouncement` is self-certifying — verifying key is embedded in `node_id` URI, no third party needed.
- `operator_display_name` is optional; the canonical form skips it when absent (handled by `canonical_object_json` silently skipping absent fields).
- Phase 1 TTL: 90 days (`valid_until = now + 90d`), spec 3.5.6.
- `is_expired()` is a separate check from signature verification — expiry is checked first.
- Persistence uses the caller-supplied path (Pattern A: data alongside the binary).

## Entry J-012 — Layer 6: Federation Handshake

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 6 — federation handshake (121 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.4.2`

Layer 6 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Two new modules in `xgen-node/src/federation/`
plus extensions to the wire and transport layers, bringing the total test count from 100 to 121.

Note on versioning: Layer 6 corresponds to spec section 3.4, so the tag is `v0.4.2` (state=0,
section=4, session=2) — numerically lower than the Layer 5 tag (`v0.5.2`) because the
implementation order does not match the spec's section order.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `wire/types.rs` | 3.4.2 | Added `FederationCapabilities`, `NegotiatedCapabilities`, `FederationMessage` (5 variants: hello, capabilities, accept, reject, goodbye) |
| `transport/connection.rs` | 3.4.2 | Added `Inbound::Federation`, `send_federation()`, updated `recv()` to dispatch on "federation." prefix |
| `federation/handshake.rs` | 3.4.1–3.4.7 | Full handshake state machine: `run_initiating`, `run_receiving`, `sign_msg`, `verify_msg`, `negotiate_serialisation`, `negotiate_version`; canonical field orders per message type |
| `federation/registry.rs` | 3.4.5 | `FederationRegistry` — persistent federation relationship store, keyed by peer node_id; JSON file persistence; `FederationRelationship::from_session()` |
| `federation/mod.rs` | 3.4 | Module declaration + integration tests |

Test coverage added (21 new tests):

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `negotiate_serialisation_picks_highest_preference` | First entry in our preference list that appears in peer's list is selected |
| `negotiate_serialisation_picks_first_common` | Order of our preference list determines the selection |
| `negotiate_serialisation_no_overlap_returns_none` | Disjoint format sets → None |
| `negotiate_version_lower_minor_wins` | Lower minor version of the two is selected |
| `negotiate_version_major_mismatch_returns_none` | Major version mismatch → None |
| `sign_verify_hello_round_trip` | Sign + verify cycle for federation.hello |
| `sign_verify_capabilities_round_trip` | Sign + verify cycle for federation.capabilities |
| `sign_verify_accept_round_trip` | Sign + verify cycle for federation.accept |
| `tampered_node_id_fails_verification` | Substituting a different node_id is caught |
| `session_id_is_deterministic_and_sorted` | Same pair always produces same session_id regardless of argument order |
| `message_type_field_serialises_correctly` | Serde tag produces "federation.hello" etc.; absent signature not serialised |
| `federation_capabilities_default_is_json_only` | Default caps: json only |
| `upsert_and_get` | Registry stores and retrieves a relationship |
| `upsert_updates_existing` | Upsert with same peer_node_id overwrites |
| `remove_returns_and_deletes` | remove() returns the entry and leaves registry empty |
| `all_returns_all_entries` | Multiple relationships all returned |
| `save_load_round_trip` | JSON persistence round-trip |
| `empty_registry_saves_and_loads` | Empty registry serialises and deserialises correctly |
| `full_handshake_reaches_active_both_session_ids_match` | Integration: two in-process Nodes run full handshake; both reach ACTIVE with matching session_id |
| `shared_spaces_propagate_through_handshake` | Integration: shared_spaces from hello are present in both sessions |
| `registry_stores_session_and_round_trips` | FederationRelationship::from_session() + registry stores correctly |

Design decisions:
- `FederationMessage` variants carry `signature: Option<String>` with `skip_serializing_if`. None during construction, Some after `sign_msg()`. Canonical JSON excludes `signature` because it is not in the per-variant field order constant.
- `Inbound::Federation(FederationMessage)` added alongside `Inbound::Event` and `Inbound::Transport` in `connection.rs`. The `recv()` dispatcher now branches on "federation." type prefix.
- `session_id` = `hash_uri(sorted(node_a, node_b) || timestamp)`. Node IDs are sorted alphabetically so the same pair always produces the same derivation regardless of which side is initiating.
- The receiving Node sends `federation.reject` (with appropriate 2xxx error code) before returning the error, ensuring the peer is informed.
- `FederationRegistry` persists as a flat JSON array of `FederationRelationship` objects.

## Entry J-013 — Layer 7: Identity Registration

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Commit:** *(this session)* — *Implement Layer 7 — identity registration (142 tests passing)*
**Tag:** `v0.6.2`

Layer 7 of the Phase 1 implementation is complete. Two new modules in `xgen-node/src/identity/`
plus extensions to the wire and transport layers, bringing the total test count from 121 to 142.

Files implemented:

| File | Spec ref | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `wire/types.rs` | 3.6.3–3.6.8 | Added `IdentityDeviceEntry`, `IdentityMessage` (7 variants: register, register_ok, register_fail, get, record, not_found, update) |
| `transport/connection.rs` | 3.6 | Added `Inbound::Identity`, `send_identity()`, updated `recv()` to dispatch on "identity." prefix |
| `identity/registry.rs` | 3.6.6 | `IdentityRecord`, `DeviceRecord`, `IdentityRegistry` — persistent identity store keyed by identity_id; JSON file persistence; `apply_update()` with monotonic version enforcement |
| `identity/registration.rs` | 3.6.3–3.6.5 | 8-step acceptance pipeline (`accept_registration`); Local Node mode skips steps 4–7; `sign_register`, `verify_register`, `sign_update`, `verify_update`, `build_register`; canonical form for signing |

Test coverage added (21 new tests):

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `sign_verify_register_round_trip` | Sign + verify cycle for identity.register |
| `tampered_display_name_fails_verification` | Any field change breaks verification |
| `local_node_accept_pipeline_succeeds` | Full 8-step pipeline in Local Node mode |
| `identity_mismatch_rejected` | Step 1: identity_id must match transport auth |
| `already_registered_rejected` | Step 3: duplicate registration refused |
| `trust_assertion_required_in_non_local_mode` | Step 4: non-local mode requires assertion |
| `display_name_too_long_rejected` | Step 8: >128 char name refused |
| `empty_display_name_rejected` | Step 8: empty string refused |
| `display_name_with_control_char_rejected` | Step 8: control characters refused |
| `no_display_name_accepted` | Optional display_name — None accepted |
| `sign_verify_update_round_trip` | Sign + verify for identity.update |
| `register_and_get` | Registry stores and retrieves a record |
| `duplicate_registration_rejected` | Registry-level duplicate check |
| `contains_returns_false_for_unknown` | contains() on absent identity |
| `apply_update_higher_version_succeeds` | update_version must increase |
| `apply_update_same_version_rejected` | Stale update rejected |
| `apply_update_to_unknown_identity_fails` | Update on unregistered identity |
| `save_load_round_trip` | JSON persistence round-trip |
| `empty_registry_saves_and_loads` | Empty registry serialises correctly |
| `local_node_registration_end_to_end` | Integration: full register flow over transport; client → server → register_ok |
| `duplicate_registration_returns_fail` | Integration: second register → error code 3007 |

Design decisions:
- `MAX_DISPLAY_NAME_LEN = 128` — spec does not specify; 128 provides generous room for unicode display names while rejecting obvious abuse. Recorded here.
- `IdentityMessage::Record` uses inline fields (no dependency from wire layer to identity layer). Registry converts `IdentityRecord` → `IdentityMessage::Record` at the call site.
- `signature: Option<String>` on `identity.register` and `identity.update` only — Node responses (register_ok, register_fail, record, not_found) are not signed by the Identity key.
- Phase 1: `identity_id == device_id` (single device). The `devices` array exists from day one for Phase 2 multi-device support without schema changes.
- Canonical signing order for `identity.register`: `[protocol_version, type, identity_id, display_name, trust_assertion, timestamp]`. Absent optional fields silently skipped.
