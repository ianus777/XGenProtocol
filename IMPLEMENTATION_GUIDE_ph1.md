## Overview

This guide directs Phase 1 implementation of the XGen Protocol. Phase 1 produces a working two-Node, two-user, one-Room federated messaging system. The definition of done is the smoke test in spec section 3.7.11.

All implementation decisions must be consistent with `docs/xgen_ch3_specification.md`. When the guide and the spec conflict, the spec is authoritative. When the spec is ambiguous, flag the ambiguity before implementing — do not resolve it silently.

---

## Architecture Principle — Library-First Structure

All Phase 1 Rust code MUST be structured as a library with a thin CLI shell on top. This is not optional — it is the architectural decision that makes Phase 2 Tauri integration possible without rewriting the backend.

**The pattern:**

```
xgen-node/src/
  main.rs       ← thin CLI entry point only — argument parsing, startup, shutdown
  lib.rs        ← all Node logic exposed as a clean public API
  ...           ← all other modules (crypto, wire, transport, etc.)

xgen-client/src/
  main.rs       ← thin CLI entry point only — command parsing, output formatting
  lib.rs        ← all client logic exposed as a clean public API
  commands.rs   ← CLI command definitions only
```

`main.rs` contains only: argument parsing, initialisation sequence, calling into `lib.rs`, and printing results to stdout. It has no business logic.

`lib.rs` contains: everything else. All functions in `lib.rs` that will be called from the Tauri frontend in Phase 2 must be `pub` and must not depend on stdin/stdout.

**In Phase 2:**
- `main.rs` is replaced by the Tauri entry point
- `lib.rs` is unchanged
- The Tauri frontend calls the same `lib.rs` functions via `invoke()` that the CLI was calling directly
- Protocol logic is untouched

**In Cargo.toml, declare both targets:**

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "xgennode"
path = "src/main.rs"

[lib]
name = "xgennode_lib"
path = "src/lib.rs"
```

This is a mandatory structural requirement. Claude Code must enforce it from the first file written.

## Deployment Model

Each XGen binary is a single self-contained executable. No runtime dependencies, no external libraries, no registry entries. The executable discovers its own location on first run and creates all required files and folders alongside itself. The folder is the application — deleting it removes everything cleanly.

**This is a permanent architectural principle, not a Phase 1 convenience.** It applies equally to Phase 2 and all future versions. No future feature, capability, or platform requirement justifies deviating from it. If a future requirement appears to demand external files or system-level integration, the correct solution is to bundle or embed — never to scatter.

### Node deployment structure

```
<any folder the operator chooses>\
  xgennode.exe                    ← the Node binary
  node_config.json                ← created on first run if absent
  node_keypair.enc                ← encrypted Ed25519 private key, created on first run
  auth_modules.json               ← trusted Auth Module registry, created on first run
  federation_registry.json        ← federation relationships, created on first run
  identity_registry.json          ← registered Identity records, created on first run
  spaces.json                     ← Space and Room state, created on first run
  event_logs\                     ← Room Event DAGs, created on first run
    <space_id>\                   ← one subfolder per Space
      <room_id>.jsonl             ← one append-only log per Room
  logs\                           ← operational logs, created on first run
    xgennode.log
```

### Client deployment structure

```
<any folder the user chooses>\
  xgenclient.exe                  ← the client binary
  client_config.json              ← created on first run if absent
  client_keypair.enc              ← encrypted Ed25519 private key, created on first run
  known_nodes.json                ← Node endpoint registry
  logs\
    xgenclient.log
```

### First-run initialisation sequence

On first run, both binaries:

1. Detect executable location — all data paths are relative to this folder
2. Check for existing keypair file — if absent, generate Ed25519 keypair and save encrypted
3. Check for existing config file — if absent, write default config and prompt operator to review
4. Create all required subfolders if absent (`event_logs\`, `logs\`)
5. Start normal operation

The operator never needs to configure paths. The binary manages everything inside its own folder.

### Multiple instances for testing

To run two Nodes on the same machine for Phase 1 testing:

```
C:\XGenTest\
  NodeA\
    xgennode.exe    ← copy of the binary
    ...             ← Node A's data files
  NodeB\
    xgennode.exe    ← copy of the binary
    ...             ← Node B's data files
```

Each Node has its own keypair and its own data. Both run simultaneously on different ports. This is the exact setup for the Phase 1 smoke test.

### Implementation note

In Rust, use `std::env::current_exe()` to get the executable path, then `parent()` to get the containing folder. All file paths are constructed relative to this base path. Never use hardcoded paths or platform-specific config directories (no AppData, no ~/.config) — the folder-is-the-application principle must hold.

```rust
fn base_dir() -> PathBuf {
    std::env::current_exe()
        .expect("Cannot determine executable location")
        .parent()
        .expect("Executable has no parent directory")
        .to_path_buf()
}
```

## Implementation Order

Implement in this exact order. Each layer depends on the previous. Do not skip ahead.

### Layer 1 — Cryptographic Foundation
**Spec refs:** 3.1.6, 3.1.9, 3.2.3, 3.2.4

1. `crypto/encoding.rs` — base64url encode/decode (no padding, URL-safe alphabet)
2. `crypto/hashing.rs` — SHA-256 hash of bytes → lowercase hex → hash URI
3. `identity/keypair.rs` — Ed25519 keypair generation, encrypted storage, loading
4. `crypto/signing.rs` — sign bytes with private key, verify signature with public key
5. `wire/canonical.rs` — produce canonical JSON form of a message (sorted keys, no whitespace)

**Test:** Generate a keypair, sign a known byte sequence, verify the signature. Derive a hash URI from a known input and check the output format.

---

### Layer 2 — Wire Format
**Spec refs:** 3.1.1–3.1.10, 3.2.1, 3.2.2

1. `wire/types.rs` — define Rust structs for all Phase 1 message types with serde derives:
   - `Event` (the base envelope, spec 3.2.1)
   - All transport messages: `TransportChallenge`, `TransportAuth`, `TransportAuthOk`, `TransportAuthFail`, `TransportError`, `TransportGoodbye`, `TransportSyncRequest`, `TransportRateLimit`
   - All federation messages: `FederationHello`, `FederationCapabilities`, `FederationAccept`, `FederationReject`, `FederationGoodbye`
   - All identity messages: `IdentityRegister`, `IdentityRegisterOk`, `IdentityRegisterFail`, `IdentityUpdate`, `IdentityGet`
   - All space/room messages: `StateSpaceCreate`, `StateDmSpaceCreate`, `StateRoomCreate`, `MembershipInvite`, `MembershipJoin`, `MembershipLeave`, `MembershipKick`, `MembershipBan`
   - All message events: `MessageText`, `MessageImage`, `MessageFile`, `MessageReaction`, `MessageRedact`
2. `wire/framing.rs` — encode/decode transport frame: `[1-byte length][format string][4-byte payload length][payload]` (spec 3.1.2)
3. `wire/validation.rs` — implement the 13-step Event validation pipeline (spec 3.2.6). Steps 1–7 are pure structural checks; steps 8–13 require crypto and state context

**Test:** Serialise an `Event` struct to JSON, wrap in a transport frame, unwrap the frame, deserialise back, verify round-trip equality.

---

### Layer 3 — DAG and Event Storage
**Spec refs:** 3.2.3, 3.2.5

1. `dag/store.rs` — append-only in-memory Event store (Phase 1: no persistence required). Store Events by `event_id`. Retrieve by ID.
2. `dag/graph.rs` — track DAG tips (Events with no successors). On new Event: validate `prev_events` all exist, check for cycles, update tips.
3. `dag/pending.rs` — buffer for Events whose `prev_events` are not yet known. On receiving a missing predecessor, process any unblocked pending Events.

**Test:** Insert a sequence of Events forming a fork (two Events with the same prev), then a merge. Verify tips are correct after each insertion.

---

### Layer 4 — Transport
**Spec refs:** 3.3.1–3.3.9

1. `transport/server.rs` — start a WebSocket server on configured endpoint. Accept connections. Hand each connection to `connection.rs`.
2. `transport/connection.rs` — implement the 4-phase connection lifecycle (CONNECT → AUTHENTICATE → ACTIVE → CLOSE). Enforce timeout on authentication.
3. `transport/auth.rs` — implement challenge-response: generate nonce, send `TransportChallenge`, receive `TransportAuth`, verify signature, send `TransportAuthOk` or `TransportAuthFail`.
4. `transport/client.rs` — connect outbound to a peer Node endpoint. Run the same authentication as a client (respond to challenge with signed nonce).
5. Keepalive: WebSocket ping every 30s, disconnect if pong not received within 10s.
6. Reconnection: exponential backoff with jitter on connection loss.

**Test (Local Node):** Start a Node in Local Node mode. Connect a second Node client. Complete authentication. Exchange a ping/pong. Verify connection drops cleanly on `TransportGoodbye`.

---

### Layer 5 — Node Identity and Announcement
**Spec refs:** 3.5.1–3.5.8

1. `node/announcement.rs` — produce a signed `node_announcement`. Load from disk if exists; generate if first run.
2. On transport connection established: send current announcement to peer.
3. Receive and store peer announcements. Verify signature. Check `valid_until`. Apply `announcement_version` gating.

**Test:** Generate two Node announcements. Verify one supersedes the other based on `announcement_version`.

---

### Layer 6 — Federation Handshake
**Spec refs:** 3.4.1–3.4.7

1. `federation/handshake.rs` — implement the full state machine: IDLE → HELLO_RECEIVED → CAPS_SENT → ACTIVE → CLOSED.
2. Capability negotiation: compute intersection of `serialisation` arrays, select highest-preference common format, negotiate protocol minor version (lower wins).
3. On `federation.accept`: record the `session_id`. Produce `state.federation_add` Event in each shared Space's DAG.
4. `federation/registry.rs` — persistent federation relationship registry (JSON file on disk). Consult on startup to re-establish connections.

**Test:** Two Node instances on localhost. Run the full handshake. Verify both reach ACTIVE state and the `session_id` matches.

---

### Layer 7 — Identity Registration
**Spec refs:** 3.6.1–3.6.9

1. `identity/registry.rs` — persistent Identity record store (JSON file on disk for Phase 1).
2. Receive `IdentityRegister`. Run the 8-step acceptance pipeline (spec 3.6.4). In Local Node mode: skip steps 4–7.
3. On success: create Identity record, store to disk, send `IdentityRegisterOk`.
4. Handle `IdentityGet` queries.

**Test (Local Node):** Client generates keypair. Authenticates transport. Sends `IdentityRegister` (no trust assertion — Local Node mode). Verify Node creates record and responds with `IdentityRegisterOk`.

---

### Layer 8 — Space and Room Protocol
**Spec refs:** 3.7.1–3.7.11

1. `space/state.rs` — Space and Room state derived from Event DAG. Track current state by processing State Events in causal order.
2. Handle `StateSpaceCreate`: derive Space ID from Event hash, create Space state, creator becomes owner.
3. Handle `StateRoomCreate`: derive Room ID from Event hash, create Room state in Space.
4. Handle `StateDmSpaceCreate`: create DM Space with single auto-Room, send `MembershipInvite` to invitee.
5. `space/membership.rs` — handle all `membership.*` Events: join, leave, invite, kick, ban. Enforce role permission table (spec 3.7.8).
6. Handle `space.join_request` from federated Node. In Phase 1: auto-approve. Produce `state.federation_add`.
7. On federation established: send full Space state and Room Event history to new Node.

**Test:** Alice creates a Space and Room on Node A. Bob's Node B federates. Bob joins Space and Room. Verify both Nodes have identical Space/Room state.

---

### Layer 9 — Message Exchange
**Spec refs:** 3.2.2 (`message.*` EventTypes), 3.2.6

1. Accept `MessageText` Events from authenticated, authorised clients.
2. Run full 13-step validation pipeline.
3. Store in Room DAG. Update tips.
4. Propagate to all federated Nodes that participate in the Space.

**Test:** Alice sends "Hello Bob". Verify Event appears in Node B's Room DAG with correct `event_id`, valid signature, correct `prev_events`.

---

### Layer 10 — Smoke Test
**Spec refs:** 3.7.11

Run the full 17-step Phase 1 smoke test exactly as written in the spec. Both regular Space and DM Space variants must pass.

This is the Phase 1 definition of done. ✅

---

## Local Node Mode

All development and testing uses Local Node mode throughout Layers 1–10. Local Node mode means:

- `local_node: true` in Node config
- No TLS — use `ws://` not `wss://`
- No Trust Assertion required for Identity registration
- No external network interfaces — localhost only
- 256KB message size ceiling

Do not implement production TLS or Trust Assertion validation until the smoke test passes in Local Node mode.

---

## Error Handling Conventions

- Use `thiserror` for library error types, `anyhow` for application-level errors
- Every validation failure maps to a defined error code from the spec (1xxx transport, 2xxx federation, 3xxx identity)
- Error display follows the spec format: `Error <code> (<string>): <description>` (spec 3.3.8)
- Never panic in network-handling code — use `Result` and propagate errors
- Log every rejected Event with the step number that failed and the error code

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for every crypto primitive (sign/verify round-trip, hash derivation, base64url)
- Unit tests for canonical form serialisation — known input → known output
- Unit tests for transport frame encode/decode round-trip
- Unit tests for Event validation pipeline — one test per validation step, including failure cases
- Integration tests for each Layer using two in-process Node instances on localhost
- Smoke test as the final integration test (Layer 10)

Run `cargo test` after completing each Layer before moving to the next.

## Implementation Decision Log — Mandatory Rule

During implementation, decisions will be made that are not covered by the spec — how a particular module is structured, why a specific storage approach was chosen, what tradeoffs were encountered, what the spec turned out to be ambiguous about in practice. These decisions MUST be recorded.

**Rule:** Every implementation decision that goes beyond what the spec explicitly prescribes must be noted in `DECISIONS.md` in the project root before moving to the next layer.

`DECISIONS.md` is not a formal document — it is a running log. Each entry needs only:

```
## <short title>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Layer: <which implementation layer this relates to>
Spec ref: <section number if applicable>

<What the decision was, why it was made, what alternatives were considered, what tradeoffs were accepted.>
```

Example entry:

```
## Event log storage format — append-only JSONL per Room
Date: 2026-05-01
Layer: 3 — DAG and Event Storage
Spec ref: 3.2.5

Chose one .jsonl file per Room (one JSON Event per line) rather than a single
database. Reason: simplest possible format for Phase 1, human-readable,
easy to inspect during debugging, no external database dependency. Tradeoff:
no indexing — full scan required to find an Event by ID. Acceptable for Phase 1
with small Event counts. Phase 2 will likely need an index.
```

**Why this matters:** These entries are the raw material for Chapter 4. They capture the honest history of what was built and why — decisions that will otherwise be forgotten by the time Chapter 4 is written. They also feed back into spec revisions: if an implementation decision reveals a spec ambiguity, that ambiguity is fixed in the spec before Phase 2 begins.

---

## What Comes Next

After the Phase 1 smoke test passes:

1. Return to the spec project to write **Chapter 6 — Client Design** (`docs/xgen_ch6_client_design.md`). This covers the UI vision, CSS/theming system, screen inventory, and client technology choice. UI decisions made here feed directly into Phase 2 protocol requirements — Chapter 6 must be complete before Phase 2 spec sections are written.
2. Write Chapter 3 Phase 2 spec sections — informed by Phase 1 implementation experience AND Chapter 6 UI requirements.
3. Begin Phase 2 implementation.

Do not start Phase 2 implementation before both Chapter 6 and the Phase 2 spec sections are written.

**Phase 2 UI technology stack (confirmed, see `docs/xgen_ch6_client_design.md`):**

Phase 1 produces CLI binaries only — no graphical UI. Phase 2 replaces the CLI client with full desktop applications built on **Tauri + Svelte**.

- **Tauri** — desktop application framework wrapping the Rust backend with a native OS webview. Produces a single self-contained executable, Pattern A compliant. No Electron, no Node.js runtime.
- **Svelte** — frontend framework for the web UI layer inside Tauri. Chosen for minimal JavaScript overhead — components are written as HTML/CSS files with a thin script block. Full CSS custom property support for the design system and Space theming.
- Both `xgennode.exe` (Node admin UI) and `xgenclient.exe` (Client UI) use this stack.
- A shared package `xgen-ui-shared/` contains the CSS design token system and reusable Svelte components. One design system, two applications, maximum reuse.

The Phase 1 CLI codebase is not thrown away — the Rust backend logic (crypto, DAG, transport, federation) becomes the Tauri backend for Phase 2. The CLI is replaced by the Svelte frontend. Protocol logic is unchanged.
